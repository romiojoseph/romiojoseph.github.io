in  <a href="/blog/category/bluesky"> Bluesky </a> </span> </p> <img class="post-social-card" src="https://romiojoseph.github.io/assets/cover-images/featured/notes.avif" alt="Cover for New Writing Tools"> <div class="markdown-body post-content"><p>Creating (or vibe coding) with LLMs is not as easy as people say. It has its ups and downs. The main issue I faced is with bug fixing in bigger projects. Sometimes it just deletes lines from JavaScript files and says it&#39;s &quot;optimized&quot; or &quot;minified&quot; for stability. But when I test all the features, I see no errors, because the feature itself is gone or disabled and in some cases it will be there, but with a lot of another chain of errors. This is the most annoying part when you’re vibe coding.</p>
<p>Sometimes, the entire chat just breaks when it starts acting like this. And I have to start over. In the beginning, it didn’t bother me much. But once I started trying slightly bigger projects, I felt the need to keep a prompt library with follow up messages.</p>
<p>I started with Obsidian. <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romiojoseph.github.io/post/3lhnzhlhvls2l">It felt like too much</a> for a simple workflow. Then I tried the so called Windows &quot;<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/romiojoseph.github.io/post/3lmgmwiw3ec2v">Sticky Notes (New)</a>&quot;. The classic one was fine, but the new one is slow and bloated. It takes forever to open. And even after it opens, setting up the note takes time. I feel like they killed the app. It used to be quick and simple, now it’s just heavy and annoying.</p>
<p>Then I switched to Notepad. It’s fast, but the problem is I need to save every file manually. If I don’t, I get that pop up asking what to do with the file, which breaks my flow. Especially when I’m in a hurry. For one off notes, it’s fine. But when I work, I like to keep only the windows I need. So even Notepad became annoying.</p>
<p>I even tried pinning basic prompts to clipboard history. It seemed okay at first. But once the list grew, scrolling through it broke the flow.</p>
<p>Around this time, I started thinking about a <a href="https://romiojoseph.github.io/bluesky/draft-bluesky-threads/">Bluesky thread drafting tool</a>. But due to some complexity and limitations, I narrowed it down to a local system where users could write freely, and it would handle thread formatting. It was just an experiment.</p>
<p>After that, I started building this browser-based Writer app, which is a PWA. I don’t know if anyone else uses it. I don’t really care at this point. It fits my workflow perfectly right now. No idea how it’ll turn out later, but for now it’s just right. As LLMs improve at keeping context, I think I’ll be able to experiment more. Right now, as always, there&#39;s no login or trackers.</p>

<p>The app is simple. You can write multiple docs. You can take snapshots at any point to jump back and forth. There’s a word frequency list, and a focus mode to cut distractions. I even added a security pin. It&#39;s a small thing, but feels good. You can set goals and see some metrics. And there&#39;s auto-save every few seconds, so I can close it anytime without losing data.</p>
<p>My current idea is this: users own their data. It&#39;s their job to handle it. So there&#39;s an import/export option too. Everything is saved locally in the browser. It&#39;s meant to be a space for short-term notes, stuff you want to write and keep for a few hours or days. It will be there as long as you are not clearing the browser data.</p>
<p>For README or other quick markdown files,, I didn’t want to open Obsidian. These are quick one time tasks, and I delete them once done. So I made another markdown editor for the web. Just write, click to style, no need to remember the syntax. Then download the file.</p>

<p>Both editors work in the browser. They use local storage, so immediate data loss is not a worry. But again, it’s the user’s responsibility. That’s the motto I like these days. And this setup fits my current workflow well.</p>
